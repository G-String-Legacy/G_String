# G_String_L == G_String Legacy
Generalizability Analysis and Synthesis Program
GS is an extension of Robert Brennan's small C program 'urGENOVA'. Originally written in C# on a Windows machine, as a structured way to write control files for urGENOVA, it gradually has become a complete Generalizability Analysis program, written in Java, and running on Linux, IOS and Windows. The current version - VI - can even generate synthetic data files based on a given model with specified sample sizes, mean and variance components.
Currently in build 25, it includes help, log and other diagnostic features, as well as user modifiable preferences.
It uses a program generated step-by-step process that leads the novice by the hand, and speeds up usage for the expert.

The purpose of this site is to develop a platform that serves as a hub for the community of G_String users to gradually take ownership, not only of the current status of G_String, but of its future health and adaptation to evolving user needs, and to support and educate users. You are invited to become active as participants in the discussions, by asking and answering queries, by suggesting and guiding new venues in how to use the software, and how to develop it further.
As the community becomes stronger, I will fade away.
My programming task now is to complete G_String_L, a version as bug free as possible, and well documented, so it will be possible for you to understand the code, and continuously build it further.
