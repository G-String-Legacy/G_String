# G_String_VI
Generalizability Analysis and Synthesis Program
GS is an extension of Robert Brennan's small C program 'urGENOVA'. Originally written in C# on a Windows machine, as a structured way to write control files for urGENOVA, it gradually has become a complete Generalizability Analysis program, written in Java, and running on Linux, IOS and Windows. The latest version - VI - can even generate synthetic data files based on a given model with specified sample sizes, mean and variance components.
Currently in build 25, it includes help, log and other diagnostic features, as well as user modifiable preferences.
It uses a program generated step-by-step process that leads the novice by the hand, and speeds up usage for the expert.

The purpose of this site is to work (and ultimately publish) a detailed documentation on the latest version of G_String_VI that should help future users to deal with software problems, once the creator of the software is no longer able to do so.
