## Generalizability Analysis with G_String
This repository serves as community platform for investigators applying G_String software for Generalizability Analysis of performance assessments.
Specifically, it provides:
- A [discussion forum for methodological issues in Generalizability Analysis](../../discussions/1).
- A [discussion forum for technical issues with G_String](../../discussions/12).
- [Help in downloading and installing the newest version](../../tree/main/Support/get_G_String.md).
- Resources for G_String in [Wiki](../../wiki).
- An open-source [work bench](../../tree/main/workbench/workbench.md) to keep G_String alive.
- [A way to join **G-String-Legacy**](../../blob/main/Support/membership.md).
- G_String [mind map](../../tree/main/vault/About.md) (still growing).
 
The deeper purpose of this site is to develop an [Open Source](../../tree/main/vault/Open_Source.md) community of Generalizabilty users who will ensure long term G_String maintenance support for future generations. Ultimately, it isÂ you, a member of the user community, who will have to depend on the viability of this platform. If we all contribute, G_String will be around for many years to come!
