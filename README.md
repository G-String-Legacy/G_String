## Generalizability Analysis with G_String
This repository serves as community platform for investigators applying G_String software for Generalizability Analysis of performance assessments.
Specifically, it provides:
#### [An answer to the question Why G_String on GitHub](../../tree/main/vault/github.md)? ####
#### [A discussion forum for methodological issues in Generalizability Analysis](../../discussions/1). ####
#### [A discussion forum for technical issues with G_String](../../discussions/12). ####
#### [Information for G_String users](../../tree/main/vault/users.md). ####
#### [Information for Software Professionals](../../tree/main/vault/professionals.md). ####
 
The deeper purpose of this site is to develop an [Open Source](../../tree/main/vault/Open_Source.md) community of Generalizabilty users who will ensure long term G_String maintenance support for future generations. Ultimately, it isÂ **you**, a member of the user community, who will have to depend on the viability of this platform. If **we all contribute**, G_String will be around for many years to come!
