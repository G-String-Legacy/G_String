## Generalizability Analysis with G_String
This repository serves as community platform for investigators applying G_String software for Generalizability Analysis of performance assessments.
Specifically, it provides:
- A [discussion forum for methodological issues in Generalizability Analysis](../../discussions/1).
- A [discussion forum for technical issues with G_String](../../discussions/2).
- [Current releases of G_String.](../../../G_String/releases/tag/1.0.0)
- Branches for evolving new versions of G_String.
- Resources for G_String in [Wiki](../../wiki).
- An open-source [work bench](workbench) to keep G_string alive.
 
Help documentation and additional information can be found in this repository's [Wiki section](https://github.com/Papa-26/gsvi_root/wiki).
But the deeper purpose of this site is to develop a community of Generalizabilty users who will ensure long term G_String maintenance support beyond the death of its creator.

Ultimately, it is **you**, a member of the user community, who will have to depend on the viability of this platform. If **you** won't put in **your** effort, don't be astonished if G_String won't be around anymore in a few years!
