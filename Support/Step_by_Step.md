## Step by Step Workflow ##
Software professionals like to endow their products with all the functional bells and whistle they can think of. That is great for the expert user. But occasional users frequently get confused, if there are many different ways of solving a problem. G_String is used for only two purposes: 

<ol type="1">
  <li>analyzing experimental data (scores) from a performance assessment; </li>
  <li>generating a synthetic set of scores for teaching, learning, or experimenting; </li>
</ol>

Each of these two goals can be achieved in one of two ways:

<ol type="a">
  <li>for a totally new problem, parameters are entered manually;</li>
  <li>for a recurring problem a script with manual override can relieve the tedium.</li>
</ol>
