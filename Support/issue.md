## If you suspect a bug, what now? ##
Let's assume then that you have problems with G_String, that you have installed the latest version, that you have exhausted 'Troubleshooting' in the [User Manual](../../main/Support/Manual.pdf), and that you have used the discussion fora. To take it any further, you have to become a [member](membership.md) of G_Legacy. Don't worry, it won't cost you anything.

Once you are a member, you have to raise an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue), to bring the problem to the attention of the people who look after G_Legacy. To deal with your issue, it is important that we know exactly what went wrong, and under what conditions the problems occured.
