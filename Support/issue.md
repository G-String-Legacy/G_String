Let's assume then that you have problems with G_String, that you have installed the latest version, and that you have exhausted 'Troubleshooting' in the [user Manual](../..//blob/main/Support/Manual.pdf). To take it any further, you have to become a [member](membership.md) of G_Legacy. Don't worry, it won't cost you anything.
