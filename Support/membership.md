## Membership in 'G-String-Legacy' ##

Anybody with an interest in Generalizability Theory and/or G_String can become a member. There is no cost, and in fact, we encourage people to join. The 'open source' nature of the G_String project allows anybody free read access to the information on its repository.

With the free membership you can get notified automatically of any updates and other developments. It also allows you to become more actively involved in topical discussions, and in shaping the future of G_String.

Becoming a member is free and easy: if you don't already have a GitHub account, [create a personal account with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account), then you [send an email with your GitHub username](mailto:ralph@papaworx.com?subject=Membership%20in%20G-String-Legacy). (**open your email client**, there is a blank message for you to fill in) You will then receive an invitation to join our platform. That's all there is to it.

Once you are a member, you can fine tune the [notifications you want to receive](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/about-notifications).

We are looking forward to meeting you!
