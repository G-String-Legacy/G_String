## Membership in 'G-String-Legacy'

Anybody with an interest in Generalizability and/or G_String can become a member. There is no cost, and in fact, we encourage such people to join. The 'open source' nature of the G_String project allows anybody free read access to the information on its repository. 

But with the free membership you can get notified automatically of any updates and other developments. It also allows you to become more actively involved in topical discussions, and in shaping the future of G_String.

Becoming a member is free and easy: first you [create a personal account with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account), then you [send an email with your GitHub username](mailto:ralph@papaworx.com?subject=Membership%20in%20G-String-Legacy"%20target=”_blank”%20rel="noopener%20noreferrer”). You will then receive an invitation to join our platform. That's all there is to it.

We are looking forward to meeting you!
