### Purpose
The purpose of this [Obsidian mind map](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) is to support future users and maintainers of G_String (**GS_L**), a computer program for Generalizability Analysis (GA), by providing a coherent collection of in depth information on the Why's and How's of GA with **GS_L**. It is also intended to support software professionals in finding and fixing bugs and other problems with **GS_L**, and to improve it further, according to the expressed needs of the user community.

### What is Generalizability Analysis
Generalizability Analysis is a statistical method of ranking the sources of variability in a  structured dataset, particularly those derived from quantitative performance assessments, with the aim of confirming the validity of the assessment. An assessment is then considered to be valid, in terms of the challenges posed, when the significantly largest source of variability is due to the individuals being assessed.

### What is GS_L?
**GS_L** is the most recent incarnation of a computer program that allows investigators to efficiently perform Generalization Analysis, without requiring extensive mathematical and statistical knowledge.

**GS_L** guides the user with the help of a graphical user interface in a stepwise fashion to:
- name and describe the assessment in dense prose;
- explicitly specify, and characterize the individual sources of variability (facets);
- specify how the facets depend on each other (nesting);
- provide a file containing the assessment scores;
- specify the nested sample sizes for each facet.

**GS_L** then returns extensive results both on the screen and optionally in a printable document.

In addition, **GS_L** is also capable of generating synthetic data sets for any experimental design, to be used for teaching and experimentation.
