## About G_String_VI
G_String_VI is the most recent 'incarnation' of G_String, a computer program for analyzing psychometric performance tests based on Generalizability Theory. It is typically employed to optimize competence exams. G_String was originally developed for the Windows platform at McMaster University in 2006 and gradually evolved since.

G_String_VI was redesigned from scratch in 2020. It is improved in three ways:

It runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
It accommodates a significantly larger range of experimental designs than earlier versions.
It incorporates a sophisticated logging system to facilitate trouble shooting.
Its upper limit for the number of data points that can be handled has been essentially eliminated.
It can now also generate synthetic data sets of any size for practice and experimentation.
The G_String line of programs has been designed and coded by Ralph Bloch as a retirement project in collaboration with Geoff Norman.


## Installation
G_String_VI runs on all major OS platforms for desktop and laptop computers. It does not run on tablets and smart phones. For all platforms the program is contained in a software package called 'G_String_VI.jar. Because G_String_VI.jar is not digitally signed, the actual installation differs slightly from operating system to operating system. Once the program has been installed initially, no further efforts are required for future updates.
