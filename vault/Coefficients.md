Let us start by defining a few variables, we are going to need for our calculations. We have 14 different effects in this example. <UL>
<LI>'E<sub>e</sub>' will stand for an effect, where 'e' is an index 0..13. </LI>
<LI>'V<sub>e</sub>' stands for the corresponding corrected variance components 'VCOR' in the table.</LI>
<LI>'f' stands as index for the five facets (0..4).</LI>
<LI>B<sub>&kappa;</sub>(E) is a bit like a boolean, it takes on the values 0 or 1 depending on the index &kappa;, and the facets within E.</LI>
<LI>A<sub>f</sub> is the 'average' sample size for F<sub>f</sub>, to be defined later.</LI>
</UL>
