The [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) defines **Open Source** as: "When a project is open source, that means **anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose.** These permissions are enforced through [an open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses)."

**Open Source**, actually, has become a social movement with its own mythology, or rather [real life stories](https://www.opensourcestories.org/).

The above mentioned guide also suggests that any true blooded open source project starts with a definition of its **goal**. So let me, [Ralph Bloch](https://papaworx.com), get this out of the way:

For the past ten year I have designed, coded, debugged, maintained, upgraded, and supported the **G_String** series of Generalizability Analysis programs as a retirement project for free. But the moment is rapidly approaching, where I no longer will be able to do so.

> My **goal**, therefore, is to create an infrastructure enabling the members of the user community of **GS_L**, the most up-to-date version of G_String, to gradually take over the responsibility for, and 'ownership' of the **GS_L Open Source Project**. The project is hosted by **GitHub**.

To this end, I am trying to make any information and tools for the future maintenance and support of G_String available in one place as user-friendly as possible.

In keeping with this goal, here is a list of resources of use for people who will manage an Open Source project:
