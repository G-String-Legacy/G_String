## GS_L Structure ##
G_String has evolved over a period of about 12 years. The first versions were coded in C# on early Visual Studio Versions. Their main function was to make it easier to use Brennan's [urGenova](https://education.uiowa.edu/casma/computer-programs).

Subsequent versions were coded in Java 8 with a graphical user interface in JavaFX. At that stage the calculation of Generalizability Coefficients, and the ability to do D-Studies were added.

The final extension with GS_6 added the ability to generate synthetic data files using the identical GUI as in the analytic part of GS. Synthetic data files are useful both in teaching Generalizability Analysis, and in experimenting with various experimental designs when planning a study.

The source code is arranged functionally in seven folders that function as 'Java packages'. Of those, two folders contain only resource files, to be used by the source code. These are listed together as 'resources'. We will next describe the structure of GS_L systematically:
