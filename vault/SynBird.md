			This Bird's eye view is important for IT professionals, in order to
			understand the code of 'SynthGroups.java'.<BR/><BR/>
			The first part of the step-by-Step workflow is straightforward.<BR/>
			Based on these design parameters, GS generates the permitted 'Variance
			Component' configurations, and presents them to the user, who then enters the estimated 'Variance Component' values for each 				configuration.<BR/>
			GS then generates the synthetic data file based on these parameters, 
			and stores the results as a properly formated GS data file.
