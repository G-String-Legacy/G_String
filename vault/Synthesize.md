## Synthesize ##
The synthetic data set is constructed by a [Monte Carlo process](../../workbench/GS_L/src/utilities/constructSimulation.java). Each Effect can take on s<sub>e</sub> values, i.e, the number of its States. Each Effect consists of a different set of Facets, which in turn can be in s<sub>f</sub> different States. We identify a specific State of a Facet f by its index i<sub>f</sub>, and the set of Facet indices corresponding to an Effect e as 
$\hat{I_{e}}$. We designate the total set of all Facet indices at a given point as $\hat{I}$.  But each set $\hat{I_{e}}$ can actually be uniquely mapped to an  integer 0 &lt; i<sub>e</sub> &lt; s<sub>e</sub>.  In fact, the total set of all facet indices $\hat{I}$ corresponds to the Effect involving all Facets, and can therefore be mapped accordingly. This mapping is based on the order and nesting of the facets, since the the sequence of facet indices is not random, but also corresponds to the sequence of scores in the data file ([code]()).

Next, for each Effect e we generate $s_{e}$ randomly distributed values $\epsilon_{e}(i_{e})$ with a defined variance $\sigma^{2}_{e}$, and a mean of 0 ([code](../../main/workbench/GS_L/src/utilities/constructSimulation.java#93)). With this terminology we can then calculate the simulated score S as:

$$S(\hat{I}) = S(i_{h}) = \mu + \sum_{e}\epsilon_{e}(i_{e})$$

where i<sub>h</sub> equals the integer index of the highest effect, and $\mu$ is the specified grand mean of all the scores ([code]()).

**Important**  
Even though the &epsilon;<sub>e</sub> are generated by a Gaussian random generator, that does not mean that they truly form a Gaussian distribution. We can only postulate that their distribution approximates a Gauss curve, as the sample size tends towards infinity!
