## Analyzing Variance ##

But why do values vary on repeated measurements? There are two possible reasons: firstly, we may not always be measuring the same thing, and secondly, there may be other, less obvious influences that confound the measured results.

The purpose of analyzing the variance is (i) to estimate the trustworthiness of results, and (ii) to identify the confounding factors. Generalizability Analysis is a tool particularly suited for analyzing the variance when evaluating the quality of task performance.

Such a performance evaluation is considered trustworthy, and therefore valid, when a major part of the total evaluation variance is directly attributable to differences between the individual people being evaluated, rather than to any other aspect of the testing procedure. **It is generally accepted that this major part has to be at least 80% of the total variance** for an evaluation to be considered valid. Thus, our task becomes to [partition the total variance](Partitioning.md) into individual components, each attributable to an individual aspects of the test, or their specific interactions. In generalizability jargon, these aspects are usually referred to as 'facets'.
