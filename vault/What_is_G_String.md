## What is G_String? ##
G_String is a multi-platform Java-8 program performing statistical analysis for professionals in education and psychometrics based on [Generalizability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizability_theory).  G_String was developed by Ralph Bloch with help from Geoff Norman over the last decade, and is currrently in version GS_L. G_String is being used widely[^1]

G_String runs on Windows, IOS, and Linux. It is targeted at users with intermediate IT skills. It uses a graphical user interface, based on JavaFX, that guides users in a [step-by-step workflow](Step_by_Step.md) from experimental design specification and data entry to the final results.

Some of the more demanding statistical calculations within G_String are performed by an integrated [ANSI C program 'urGENOVA', written by R.L. Brennan in 2001](https://education.uiowa.edu/casma/computer-programs).
