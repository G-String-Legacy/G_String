## Concept  Map ##
A concept map graphically represents the logical relationships between ideas, concepts, and facts. In a way, this is also how the human mind works. But whereas the human mind has an almost unlimited capacity to connect concepts, and does this in a more finely grained way than graphical-lexical concept maps, the latter have one great advantage: they are not as ephemeral as the human mind.

That makes concept maps particularly useful for passing on thoughts and concepts beyond the life time of their creator.  For this reason we present the logic, structure, and function of G_String as a concept map: [About GS-Legacy](About.md), with its [graphical representation](img/map.png) showing the connections. This concept map is integrated with the source code of GS_L where appropriate.

Sometimes the link needs to show a whole Java object, but sometimes a particular method or even a numbered line is of interest.  GitHub  allows you to hone in. Here is how to do it: 


|               |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|![[/img/button.png]]  | In the upper right corner of the screen are two buttonsâ€‹.  |
|![[/img/choice.png]]   | When you click on the three dots, you get a choice between jumping to named method, or two a specific line number.  |  |


Once you are done, use the regular browser 'left arrow' to return to the previous page.
