## General Remarks ##
G_String is compiled in Oracle jdk1.8.0_231 with the Gluon javafx1.8 library. It has been designed, edited, and reworked in Eclipse, Version: 2022-03 (4.23.0), Build id: 20220310-1457, and has GitHub repository https://github.com/G-String-Legacy/G_String.

The author has acquired his programming skills informally over more than 60 years in academic and clinical pursuits. As a consequence, the programming style, while attempting to keep to general rules, lacks the discipline observed by professional programmers.

The programming philosophy has been shaped by studying Kernighan & Plauger's 'Software Tools', and Niklaus Wirth's 'Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs'. Object Oriented Programming has facilitated my packaging both complex data structures and complicated algorithms into functional objects.

Generally, variables have prefixes indicating their type. Early in the development of GS, I have used 'Integer' variables, where 'int' variables would have sufficed. Most indices either start with the letter 'i', or are called i, j, k, l, m, or n. The prefix 'iar' indicates an 'Integer Array', 'dar' a 'Double Array', and 'car' a 'Character Array'. The prefix 'ial' indicates a 'Index Array List', used while accumulating an array with yet unknown size. On completion, such array lists are usually converted to fixed arrays.

The code is extensively commented. Additionally, complicated algorithms are explained further in the 'Algorithm section'.

Finally, I have to thank [Marco Jacob](https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/) , a superb Swiss teacher of design and programming. I owe him the efficient, basic structure of an archetypal, user-friendly, JavaFX based GUI.
