## Why is G_String on GitHub? 
G_String is a tool of science; science is dynamic, collaborative, and universal. Manuscripts, books and journals, based on their technologies and economies, are static, monopolistic and costly.

The advent of the Internet opened the door for dynamic, collaborative, universal, and affordable communication and work. But the unrestrained, and profit driven explosion of Internet based media has encouraged a dilution of solid, evidence-based knowledge in the society at large, and together with intentionally misleading infusions, has also destabilized social cohesion.

In January 2001 Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger conceived, and launched a free, Internet based encyclopedia, they ultimately named ['Wikipedia'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About), which since has become the most widely used, and up-to-date human knowledge repository. But in contrast to the usual culprits, this social medium is responsibly managed and curated.

Recognizing the need for a similar collaborative platform, but suited more to development in the digital field, Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and 
Scott Chacon in 2008 created a socio-technological infrastructure which is now called [GitHub](https://github.com/about). GitHub permits collaboration and version control for computer program source code, as well as for supporting text. It uses a user-friendly text-file format [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

Thus, GitHub provides an ideal platform, not only for sharing functioning versions of G_String, their source code and supportive information, but also for interactive collaboration in developing the software further, and to deepen and widen the expertise in Generalizability analysis.

But that requires user buy-in. It costs no money - but curiosity, and an urge to learn.
