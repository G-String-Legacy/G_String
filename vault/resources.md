[Block Diagram of G_String](img/block.png)  

Package  ['resources'](../../../tree/main/workbench/GS_L/src/resources) contains non-Java files that GS_L requires. The subfolder ['help'](../../../tree/main/workbench/GS_L/src/resources/help) further contains contextual help files. They are basically text files, using a rudimentary DIY markup, to give the help screens a professional look, together with 'myDialog.css'.

Three machine code files contain Brennan's 'urGENOVA' for Linux, Windows, and IOS. There are three '.png' image files for two mathematical symbols and a pointer. Two static 'About' help files provide background for Robert Brennan's contribution and G_String respectively. The file 'Prefs_Default.xml' is used for initialization of the preferences.

Finally, 'urGENOVA_manual.pdf' contains Brennan's original urGENOVA manual.
