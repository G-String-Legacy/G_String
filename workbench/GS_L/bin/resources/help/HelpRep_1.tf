<title>Replicate</title>
<para>In some designs the sample size for a facet of generalization may vary between subjects of differentiation. Typically, this can occur in clinical clerkship-, internship-, or residency-evaluations. In such situations one may have to use a process called 'replication'.</para>
<para>Brennan's subroutine 'urGENOVA requires then that the corresponding sample sizes are specified for each subject individually. For small numbers of subjects, this is not much of a problem. But with the usual number of subjects that have to be evaluated, this can become a cumbersome and error-prone task.</para>
<para>With the major version 4, GS_L is now capable of extracting these sample sizes directly from the data file, and feed it to urGenova. But setting up a G-Study with replications requires special care. GS_L captures most design errors, provides explanations, and brings users back to a step, from where they can correct their input.</para>
<para>Every project requires a unique name. It helps you find the right project file in the future. Meaningful and discriminating project names are important.</para>
