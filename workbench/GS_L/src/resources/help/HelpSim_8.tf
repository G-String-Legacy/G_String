<title>Setting Sample Sizes</title>
<para>Now it is time to tell G_String about sample sizes. Again, it will guide you through the steps, formatting the screen to help you stay oriented.</para>
<para>Simple, crossed facets only have one sample size field. The top header will tell you for which facet you are specifying sample sizes, and if appropriate, in which other facet(s) it is nested.</para>
<para>As the level of nesting increases, the screen becomes more complex. For one level of nesting you see a line of fields. The index of the containing facet increases as the sample size fields extend to the right.</para>
<para>For higher level nesting you get multiple lines of fields, each line corresponding to a specific combination of indices of the containing facets. The leftmost column will indicate the indices corresponding to this line.</para>
<para>Tab yourself through the fields of each facet, then skip to the next facet by clicking on "Next Step" until all facet sizes have been specified.</para>
<para>G_String keeps track and will guide you to the next screen when appropriate.</para>
